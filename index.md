## Why Jekyll?
Jekyll has some great advantages over WordPress. It is especially useful for websites that are information driven and must be static.
**Pros**
1. served up blazing fast
2. source controlled by default
3. highly stable
4. less complex than competitors
5. easy to understand structure since it is just a directory of files served up
6. collection of themes is built in for seamless launch in seconds
7. templates, templates, templates! 
8. can do everything and edit all files directly in GitHub
9. can use online editor with live preview and direct GitHub import/export

**Cons**
1. no GUI
2. less support and documentation
3. fewer themes
4. extensions are run at build time rather at time of request
5. harder for a client to understand
6. slight learning curve

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/HeidiRichburg/studious-potato/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/HeidiRichburg/studious-potato/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
